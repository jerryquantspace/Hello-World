1. Pause before execution
input("Press enter to execute")

The program waits for the user to press Enter before continuing.

This is just a simple way to give the user control over when the program starts.

2. Importing modules
import time
import sys
time → lets you pause the program for a specific amount of time.
sys → allows you to control how text is printed to the screen, giving more control than the normal print() function.

3. Set the text to display
text = ("hello world!" 
"this is my first programme")

text is a variable that stores a string.

Python automatically joins strings that are next to each other, so this is the same as:

text = "hello world!this is my first programme"

4. Print text one character at a time
for char in text:
    sys.stdout.write(char)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    time.sleep(0.1)
for char in text: → loops through each character in the text, one by one.
sys.stdout.write(char) → prints the character without moving to a new line.
sys.stdout.flush() → makes sure the character shows immediately.
time.sleep(0.1) → pauses for 0.1 seconds before printing the next character.

The result: the text appears like it’s being typed out slowly, like a typewriter effect.

5. Print a new line
print()

Moves the cursor to a new line after printing all the text.

6. Repeat the typing effect with another message
text = ("Press enter to close")
for char in text:
    sys.stdout.write(char)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    time.sleep(0.1)
print ()


Same typing effect as before, but this time it shows “Press enter to close” on the screen.

7. Wait for the user to close
input()

The program pauses and waits for the user to press Enter.

This keeps the window open so you can read the final message before the program ends.

Summary
The program waits for you to start.
It slowly types out “hello world!this is my first programme”.
Then it slowly types “Press enter to close”.

Finally, it waits for you to press Enter before closing.
